Hello, this is my JavaScript learning journey. Till around July 2019 I thought JS was just stupid. Then I was forced to learn a bit to understand it because I became the [gatekeeper of a JS project](https://github.com/fabfoundation/mods). Now I kind of like it. So I am learning more of it. It's just awful starting over another programming language. It reminds me the intro of the game [getting over it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXmBPIJZfVA). 

## JS courses I am following

- [w3schools Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). I learnt that vanilla JS is just JS. I wonder why would someone do that.

## JS libraries I am learning

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) 3D library
- [Two.js](https://two.js.org) 2D library
- [D3.js]() A data visualization library

## JS libraries I am not learning, but I like

- [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) For HTML presentations
- [Video.js](https://videojs.com) A customizable HTML video player
